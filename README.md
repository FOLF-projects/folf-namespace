# FOLF - a C++ library written by a fox and a wolf

FOLF is a namespace used by some perople to develop and test new algorythms. It features many benchmarking features and some smal algorythms to make our life easier. Everything works on Windows and Linux (other systems should work too, but are not suported and possibly not tested)

# why?

Because two friends wanted to do some c++ together.
