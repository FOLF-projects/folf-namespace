# FOLF - a C++ library written by a fox and a wolf
FOLF is a namespace used by some perople to develop and test new algorithms. It features many benchmarking features and some small algorithms to make our life easier. Everything works on Windows and Linux. Other OSs might work as well, but we can't guarantee this or offer support for those OSs. 

# Why?
Because two friends want to do some C++ together.

# Am I allowed to use it?
According to its license (MIT), everyone can use it under the terms of the license.
